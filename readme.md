# How to Install

If you want to stay up to date with the very latest code, clone the git repository:

    git clone git@github.com:Arko/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Or, if you don't have git, you can just download the latest source as a tarball:

    curl -L http://github.com/Arko/dotfiles/tarball/master -o arko-dotfiles-master.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf arko-dotfiles-master.tar.gz

Finally, change to the cloned or extracted dotfiles directory and run install

    ./install
